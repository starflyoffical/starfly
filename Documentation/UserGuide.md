# Roam Control User Guide

Roam Control lets you choose where your iPhone reports its location. You can hold one fixed place or simulate a walk along an Apple Maps route.

## First-time setup

You need your physical iPhone, Developer Mode and LocalDevVPN.

1. Open Roam Control and complete the four-page introduction.
2. On **Device Setup**, tap **Pair This iPhone**.
3. Allow Local Network access when iOS asks.
4. Open **Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → Pair with Roam Control**.
5. Enter the six-digit code shown by Roam Control.
6. Install LocalDevVPN from the Device Setup screen if it is not already installed.
7. Open LocalDevVPN and connect its local tunnel.

Pairing is normally required only once. Roam Control stores the pairing record in this iPhone's Keychain and does not upload it.

## Choose a location

Use any of these methods:

- Type a place into the search box and choose a live result.
- Enter coordinates such as `51.50740, -0.12780`.
- Tap anywhere on the map to drop a precise pin.
- Open the heart/list button to choose a favourite or recent location.
- Use **Resume** when Roam Control offers the last used location.

Choosing a search result clears the search box automatically. The close button on a selected-location card clears a dropped pin or selection. The copy button copies the readable place and address.

## Start a fixed location

1. Choose the location.
2. Tap **Start Location**.
3. Follow the LocalDevVPN guidance if it appears.
4. Wait for the status to show that the location is active.

There is no separate confirmation step after choosing a location.

To move an active session, choose another place and tap **Update Location**. Roam Control keeps the existing secure session and changes the location directly.

Tap **Stop & Restore** when you want iOS to return to the real location, then confirm the choice. Keep Roam Control open while it restores the real location. Roam Control deliberately does not place a stop control in the Dynamic Island, which helps prevent accidental stops while using another app.

## Wi-Fi connection flow

When Wi-Fi is connected, Roam Control looks for the iPhone through LocalDevVPN immediately.

- If LocalDevVPN is already connected, the location should start without mobile-data instructions.
- If its tunnel is unavailable, Roam Control opens LocalDevVPN automatically and returns to the pending session.
- If the connection still is not visible, the **Still Connecting** screen offers **Try Again** and **Open LocalDevVPN**.

Do not choose **I'm Using Mobile Data** while connected to Wi-Fi.

## Mobile-data connection flow

When the iPhone is using 4G or 5G:

1. Start the selected location.
2. Roam Control opens LocalDevVPN if necessary.
3. When **Turn Mobile Data Off** appears, temporarily switch mobile data off.
4. Return to Roam Control. It detects the local iPhone connection automatically.
5. If automatic detection does not continue, tap **Continue** as the manual backup.
6. When **Turn Mobile Data Back On** appears, restore mobile data and tap **Done**.

Only startup needs this temporary change. After the secure location session is active, it can continue while mobile data is back on.

## Walking routes

StarFly does not fetch routes from an administrator or import them automatically. To use your own route, open **More → Paste Route** and manually provide its route text or GPX content. Saved routes stay on this iPhone.

1. Choose a destination.
2. Tap **Preview Walking Route**.
3. Check the route, distance, estimated time and arrival time.
4. Choose a walking pace.
5. Tap **Start Walking**.

During the walk:

- **Pause** holds the current simulated point.
- **Resume** continues from that point.
- The walk can continue while another app is in front.
- **Stop & Restore** ends the walk and restores the real location after confirmation.

At the destination:

- **Walk Route Back** reverses the journey.
- **New Location** keeps the active connection and lets you choose another destination.
- **Stop & Restore** ends the session and restores the real location.

For UK regional settings, short distances are shown in yards and longer distances in miles.

## Map controls

- **Current location** flies to the iPhone's real position and turns the map north-up. It is unavailable while a simulated location is active.
- **Compass** appears after the map is rotated. It shows N, E, S and W; tap it to face north again.
- **Connection status** opens pairing and connection setup.
- **Favourites and history** opens saved places. Swipe an item to delete it; swipe a favourite to rename it.
- **Settings** controls appearance, map style, diagnostics, pairing, feedback, help and reset.

## Feedback

Under **Settings → Feedback**, **Report a Bug** and **Request a Feature** open the matching GitHub form. Do not include pairing records, credentials or private locations in a report.

## Interrupted-session recovery

If Roam Control closes without receiving a normal end signal, the next launch explains that the previous session may still be active.

- **Resume Location** reconnects to a fixed location.
- **Resume Walking** prepares the remaining route from the most recently saved point.
- **Restore Real Location** reconnects only long enough to clear the simulated location.
- **My Real Location Is Already Back** dismisses the recovery record without reconnecting.

Nothing starts automatically from this screen.

## Appearance and accessibility

Settings offers automatic, light and dark appearance plus standard, satellite and hybrid maps. Roam Control follows iOS Dynamic Type, VoiceOver and Reduce Motion settings. At accessibility text sizes, cards and pop-ups can scroll so their controls remain reachable.

## Background sessions

An active location session uses an iOS continued-processing task so it can remain reliable while Roam Control is in the background. iOS shows this task in the Dynamic Island and controls its presentation. You can swipe it up to keep it compact, but Roam Control continues to report task progress so iOS can keep the session running reliably.

## Privacy and data

StarFly does not use a StarFly server for licenses, published routes, analytics or automatic diagnostic uploads. Favourites, history, saved routes and pairing records stay on the iPhone. Maps and place search use Apple MapKit; diagnostics are shared only if you explicitly open the iOS share sheet. See [Privacy](Privacy.md).

## Favourites, history and reset

- Favourites remain until you delete them or reset the app.
- History stores the 30 most recently used locations.
- **Replay Introduction** shows onboarding without deleting anything.
- **Reset Roam Control** removes pairing, favourites, history and preferences, then returns to onboarding.
- Resetting Roam Control does not uninstall or reconfigure LocalDevVPN.

## Troubleshooting

### LocalDevVPN says Connected, but Roam Control cannot find the iPhone

Check whether you are using Wi-Fi or mobile data. On Wi-Fi, tap **Try Again**. On 4G or 5G, choose the mobile-data flow and briefly turn mobile data off. If the message mentions an outdated announcement, toggle LocalDevVPN off and on once to create a fresh device announcement.

### The discovered device does not match the paired iPhone

The saved pairing record belongs to a different device announcement. Toggle LocalDevVPN off and on. If the problem remains, open Device Setup, remove the pairing and pair this iPhone again.

### The real location is not visible after stopping

Keep Roam Control open for a few seconds while iOS obtains a fresh GPS result. Tap the current-location button after it becomes available. Also check that Location Services permission is allowed for Roam Control.

### A walking session ended unexpectedly

Reopen Roam Control and use the interrupted-session screen. Resume from the last saved point or choose **Restore Real Location**.

### I need a readable support report

Open **Settings → Connection Health**, run the connection check, then use **Share Diagnostics**. The report contains app, iOS and connection state information but no pairing keys or PINs.
